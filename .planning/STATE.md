## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: DeepSeek via OpenAI SDK — user-specified, cost-effective, OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- [Init]: Cloudflare Workers proxy — GitHub Pages cannot run server code; encrypted secrets via wrangler
- [Init]: Context-restricted responses — prevent hallucination by constraining LLM to provided resume/website data

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: DeepSeek API docs returned 403 during research. Verify OpenAI SDK compatibility and base URL directly at the start of Phase 1 before writing Worker code.
- [Phase 3]: Worker URL (*.workers.dev subdomain) is unknown until Phase 1 deploys. Set VITE_PROXY_URL in .env (not secret) after Phase 1 completes.
